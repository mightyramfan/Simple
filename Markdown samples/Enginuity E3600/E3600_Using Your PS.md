# USING YOUR POWER STATION

Once your power station is charged or while your power station is charging, it can be used to power other devices. Routinely monitor the power station’s battery charge level, discharge time, and load output during use.

> **NOTE:** If the AC receptacles are energized during AC charging, the power station’s internal batteries are bypassed and the connected devices recieve power directly from the grid. For details, see “UPS Functionality” later in this section.

**WARNING:** Do not overload the power station. Check the power requirements for all devices before connecting them to the power station. Power requirements are often listed on a device’s data label or nameplate. Exceeding the unit’s wattage/amperage capacity can damage the unit and/or electrical devices connected to it.

Some appliances and tools may have relatively low rated wattage but can draw inrush current 5 to 10 times higher than their nominal current during startup. The E3600 is designed to handle inrush currents up to 2 times of the E3600 rated output capacity. If an appliance exceeds this threshold, the unit’s overload protection will be triggered.

**WARNING:** Not all appliances under the E3600’s rated wattage are supported due to high inrush current. (Commonly seen high inrush current appliances: Miter saw, table saw, air compressor, MIG/TIG welder, refrigerator, etc.) If an overload occurs:

- **Do not attempt to restart the same appliance.**
- Repeated overload events may **permanently damage** the unit.
- Damage caused by misuse, including **continuous overloading, is not covered under warranty.**

## DC OUTPUT PANEL PROTECTIONS

The DC output panel is equipped with multiple protection features to ensure safe and reliable operation:
- **Short Circuit Protection**
	- Automatically shuts down the output if a short
circuit occurs.
	- Trigger threshold: **15A for 2 milliseconds.**
- **Overcurrent Protection**
	- Limits sustained high current draw to prevent damage.
	- Trigger threshold: **10A for 1 second.**
- **Low Voltage Protection**
	- Disconnects the DC output to prevent overdischarge of the battery.
	- Trigger threshold: **11V sustained for 5 seconds**.
- **No Backfeed Protection**
	- This system **does not support backfeed**. Connecting external power to the DC output may **permanently damage** the internal DC output control board.

**WARNING:** Do not connect any external voltage source to the DC output ports. **Backfeeding will void the warranty**.

## UPS FUNCTIONALITY

This power station has limited UPS functionality. When the power station is connected to grid power through the AC input port, you can power electrical devices through the AC ouput port. In this case, the AC power comes from the grid instead of the power station. If there is a blackout it will automatically begin energizing connected devices using energy stored in the internal batteries within 30ms.

**CAUTION:** This device does not provide 0ms switching. Do not connect devices that requires 0ms UPS, such as data servers and workstations, during AC charging.

## TO USE WIRELESS CHARGING

- Turn the unit on and wait five seconds for the unit to
initialize.
- Press and release the USB on/off button to turn on wireless charging. The button’s indicator light will turn on when wireless charging is available.
- Place a compatible device on the wireless charging pad to begin charging.
- Press and release the USB on/off button to turn off wireless charging.
