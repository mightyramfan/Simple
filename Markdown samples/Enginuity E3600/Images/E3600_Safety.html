    <p>
      <strong>WARNING:</strong> Risk of Electric Shock. If misused, the voltage generated by this power station can be deadly. Always use common sense and adhere to the manufacturer’s instructions when using this product.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>WARNING:</strong> Explosion Hazard. Do not burn or incinerate the power station. Do not expose this unit to temperatures above 140°F (60°C). Exposure to fire and extreme temperatures can cause an explosion resulting in property damage, personal injury, and death.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>WARNING:</strong> Prior to using the DC charging feature, consult the vehicle operator’s manual or the manufacturer’s website to obtain the vehicle fuse ratings. Verify that the vehicle’s electrical system and fuses can safely supply the energy required to charge the power station. If a fuse opens repeatedly during charging, disconnect the power station and determine the cause of the overload. Do not replace the fuse with a fuse rated higher than the vehicle manufacturer’s recommendation or attempt to circumvent the safety features of the fuse. Doing so could create a risk of fire.</p>
